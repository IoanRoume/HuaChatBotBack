Google Developer Student Club HUA (GDSC-HUA)
============================================

Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC’s) are community groups for college and  
university students interested in Google developer technologies. Students from all  
undergraduate or graduate programs, with an interest in growing as a developer,  
are welcome. By joining a GDSC, students grow their knowledge in a peer-to-peer  
learning environment and help to build solutions for local businesses and their  
community.  
GDSC-HUA’s main targets are to:

*   connect students interested in developer technologies with students from other  
    universities or even professionals and Google Experts,
*   help community members learn about a range of technical topics and gain new  
    skills, through hands-on workshops, events, talks and project-building activities,
*   help community members grow and apply new learning, to build great solutions for  
    local problems and give back to the community.  
    As a member of our club, one will have the opportunity to work alongside  
    professionals, help our chapter grow, reach more people and make a difference to  
    the community, but also learn new skills, in terms of event organization, workshops,  
    hackathons and study jams.
