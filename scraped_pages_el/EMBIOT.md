    EMBIoT   TitleEmbedded multi-core systems for multi-critical applications in the Internet of Things Era   Funding InstrumentQatar National Research Fund   DescriptionThe embedded systems domain is continuously evolving in terms of innovations proposed. Different kinds of systems are connected to each other and systems of systems are formed. Boundaries of application domains are alleviated and ad-hoc connections and interoperability play an increasing role. In the present situation formerly closed systems are forced to be opened up. Traditional single-core processors used as computing resources are running out of business. Multi-core and Many-core processors become available whose exploitation for critical and real-time applications is presently happening unsatisfactorily slow, inefficient and expensive. Summarizing, this means their use in certified or qualified environments is challenging. The objective of the EMBIoT project is to foster this change of embedded systems through following an innovative and sustainable service-oriented architecture approach for mixed criticality applications in multi-modal real-time environments. The EMBIoT project will provide the paradigm shift to a new and sustainable system architecture, which will be appropriate for accommodating open, multi-criticality and dynamically changing systems.
